// The event propagation mode determines in which order the elements receive the event


// Event bubling and capturing are two ways of event propagati in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in a element inside another element, and both elements have regsitered a handle for that event

// event propagation mode determines in which order the Elements receive thr event 

// if you go from top to Bottom it is capturing face 

// if you go from bottom to top it is bubbling face 


// capture phase



// target phase



// bubble phase 




// Event Bubbling

// the event is first captured and handled by the innermost Element and then propagated to outer Elements 

// Event Capturing 

// the event first capture by the outermost Element and propagated to the inner elements
